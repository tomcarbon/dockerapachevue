Here is a website that runs on localhost port 80, using docker, apache, vue, and php.

Prerequisites:

     1) docker needs to be installed.

     2) 'doit' is a LINUX script. If you are not running linux then 
     deconstruct this script for your docker commands as appropriate.


Run the script "doit" (options b, then r) to build and run this website, which should then be accessible via the browser at 'localhost'.
